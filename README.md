# PhD Dissertation in Electrical Engineering

## Topic Statement
I am working on the topic of **counterfeit integrated circuits** because I want to develop
a technique for discriminating between genuine and counterfeit integrated circuits so that that I can tell manufacturers
how to prevent counterfeit products from reaching consumers.

## Component Projects
1. [Are counterfeit integrated circuits a problem facing our society?](projects/Q01/README.md)
2. [What types of counterfeit integrated circuits exist?](projects/Q02/README.md)
3. [What are the challenges associated with detecting a counterfeit integrated circuit?](projects/Q03/README.md)
4. [Are some types of counterfeit integrated circuits easier to detect than others?](projects/Q04/README.md)
5. [What techniques already exist to detect counterfeit integrated circuits?](projects/Q05/README.md)
6. [What standards exist for managing the threat of counterfeit integrated circuits?](projects/Q06/README.md)
