## Notes

### [Are Counterfeit Integrated Circuits a problem for society?](../projects/Q01/README.md)
* "Impacting many industrial sectors, including computers, telecommunications, automotive electronics, even military systems." [1], [2]
* "Legitimate electronics companies miss out on about $100B of global revenue every year because of counterfeiting." [3]
* "Around 1% of semiconductor sales are estimated to be those of counterfeited units." [4]
* "Data provided by IHS ... shows that reports of counterfeit parts have quadrupled since 2009" [5]
* "Counterfeit ICs are of great concern to industry and government because a system malfunction can present situations that cause mission failures and health or safety concerns." [6]

### [What types of Counterfeit Integrated Circuits exist?](../projects/Q02/README.md)
* "A counterfeit component 1) is an unauthorized copy; 2) does not conform to OCM design, model, and/or performance standards; 3) is not produced by the OCM or is produced by unauthorized contractors; 4) is an off-specification, defective, or used OCM product sold as "new" or working; or 5) has incorrect or false markings and/or documentation." [2]
* "we classify the counterfeit types into seven distinct categories:"
  1. Recycled
  2. Remarked
    * "Recycled and remarked components ... jointly contribute more than 80% of counterfeit incidents." [7]
    * "Newer components can also be remarked to obtain a higher specification, such as remarking from commercial grade part to industrial or defense grade."
  3. Overproduced
  4. Out-of-spec/Defective
  5. Cloned
  6. Forged documentation
  7. Tampered

### [What techniques already exist to detect counterfeit integrated circuits?](../projects/Q05/README.md)
*  "The methods are broadly classified into physical and electrical inspections."
* **Physical Inspection Methods**
  * Low Power Visual Inspection (LPVI)
  * X-Ray Imaging
  * Microblast Analysis
  * Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM)
  * Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
  * X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF)
  * Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
  * Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS)
  * Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy (THz - TDS)
* **Electrical Inspection Methods**
  * Parametric Tests
  * Functional Tests
  * Burn-In Tests
  * Structural Tests

### [What standards exist to manage the threat of counterfeit integrated circuits?](../projects/Q06/README.md)
* "There are standards and command media in place or in development that includes guidance or requirements for detection of the counterfeit parts. One committee responsible for many of these standards is the G-19 Counterfeit Electronic Parts Committee, set forth by SAE International."
* "These are the standards as follows:"
  * [AS5553: Counterfeit Electronic Parts; Avoidance, Detection, Mitigation, and Disposition](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as5553/)
  * [ARP6178: Fraudulent/Counterfeit Electronic Parts; Tool for Risk Assessment of Distributors](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp6178/)
  * [AS6081: Fraudulent/Counterfeit Electronic Parts: Avoidance, Detection, Mitigation, and Disposition - Distributors Counterfeit Electronic Parts; Avoidance Protocol, Distributors](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as6081/)
  * [AS6496: Fraudulent/Counterfeit Electronic Parts: Avoidance, Detection, Mitigation, and Disposition - Authorized/Franchised Distribution](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as6496/)
  * [AS6171: Test Methods Standard; Counterfeit Electronic Parts](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as6171/)
  * [CCAP-101: Counterfeit Components Avoidance Program](https://www.cti-us.com/pdf/CCAP101Certification.pdf)
  * [MIL-STD-883K: Test Method Standard - Microcircuits](http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL-STD-883K_CHG-3_55826/)
